             "maintenance. The goal is to identify instances when the machinery is in a failure state, "
             "which would require maintenance or repair actions to prevent further issues or breakdowns.")
    st.write("The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and converting "
             "data types. A crucial step is creating a target variable called 'Status' that indicates whether the "
             "machinery is in a failure state (1) or not (0). This is done by analyzing predefined failure time "
             "intervals, where the data samples falling within those intervals are labeled as failures (Status = "
             "1), and the rest are labeled as normal operation (Status = 0)")
    st.write("The dataset is then split into "
             "positive (failure) and negative (non-failure) samples. To balance the classes, the negative samples "
